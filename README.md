Having spent a lot of time on Intermediate CSS which made me stay away from Javascript programming for a while, I found myself forgetting some of the basics of JS I had learnt.

The library project was a good way to help me recall some of the JS foundations I had forgotten while also making use of more advanced topics like Object Constructors and context of a function invocation.

In this project, I also made use of some properties I learnt in the Intermediate CSS module of Odin Project such as

 * Position
 * Background properties
 * Third party font family
 * CSS functions like max and minmax. This was particularly helpful in making me avoid media queries.
 * CSS Grid
 * Custom Variables
